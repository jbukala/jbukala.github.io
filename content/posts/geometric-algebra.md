## More Info
* A nice ~50min [intro talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htYh-Tq7ZBI) by game developer Freya Holmer.
* A ~45 min [animated intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60z_hpEAtD8) on geometric algebra. The rest of the videos on this channel are also quite nice at explaining it further.
